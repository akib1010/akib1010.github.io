# 1) Write a resume using a Lightweight Markup Language
For this step the most preferred language is Markdown, according to Andrew Etter in his book Moder Technical writing 
>“it is the most widely used markup language in the world” 

mainly because of its simplicity. Etter emphasizes on using this type of language because it is more human-readable, has a smaller learning curve and requires less characters. Some syntax’s of using Markdown are:

i) Adding a ‘#’ at the beginning of a sentence followed by a white space to indicate that it is a heading. For example "\# Farhan Akib Rahman" would give
	
 # Farhan Akib Rahman
 
ii) Wrapping a text with ** would make it bold. For example  "\*\*Good Habits\*\*" would give 

**Good Habits**

**Note**:Using a [GitHub flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) format is necessary for rendering a md formatted file in GitHub Pages. 

Some popular editors for Markdown suggested by Etter are:  
* [MarkdownPad](http://markdownpad.com/) (Windows)
* [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) (Mac OS)
* [ReText](https://www.linuxhelp.com/how-to-install-retext-7-0-1-on-ubuntu-18-04) (Linux)

# 2) Create a GitHub Account
Etter emphesizes on the use of distribution version control systems (DVCS) because modern software developers favor the use of such technology and would prefer to have their code and documentation stored at the same place.  
[Github](https://github.com/) is an excellent choice for a DVCS as it is the worlds largest open source repository with benefits such as:
* Cloud storage for source code
* Supports all popular programming languages 
* Streamlines iteration process

Since we will be using **GitHub Pages** to host our resume having a GitHub account is **necessary**

**Joining GitHub**  
i) Click the [link](https://github.com/login)   
ii) Click on "Create an account"  
iii) Go through the step-by-step process prompted on the screen  


# 3) Hosting on GitHub Pages
